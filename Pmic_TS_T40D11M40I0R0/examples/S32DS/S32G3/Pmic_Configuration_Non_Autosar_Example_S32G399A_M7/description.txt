2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - S32G-VNP-RDB3 (SCH-53060, Rev E1)
        2.1.2 Connections
            - Powered board through power Adapter 12V
            - Set SW10 on the board to OFF: 1-OFF, 2-OFF
        2.1.3 Debugger
            The S32 Debug Probe must be connected to J48 JTAG Cortex Debug connector.
    2.2 Software installation
        Make sure that all RTD plugins are already installed in the S32DS plugins directory
3. How to run
    3.1 Importing the project into the workspace
        After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select "Pmic_Configuration_Non_Autosar_Example_S32G399A_M7". Then click on "Finish".
        The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
        Wait for the S32 Configuration was initialized and ready.
    3.2 Add definition to support pmic non-autosar.
        - Right click to Pmic_Configuration_Non_Autosar_Example_S32G399A_M7 project
        - Select 'Properties' to open setting window.
        - Click tab 'C/C++ Build
        - Click 'Setting' configuration
        - Click 'Preprocessor"
        - Click 'Add' icon to add new definition.
        - Add macro 'USE_IPV_IIC' to use i2c ip in example.
        - Add macro 'USE_IPV_SIUL2' to use port ip in example.
        - Add macro 'USE_IPV_OCOTP' to use ocotp ip in example.
        - Click button 'Apply and Close' to update example
    3.3 Generating the S32 configuration
        The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
        The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
        Right click on the current project, then click "S32 Configuration Tool" choose "Open Peripherals".
        Pay attention to any error and warning message. If any configured value is invalid, they will be shown for user.
        Pmic component need to switch to 'Non AUTOSAR Mode' in this example.
        Make the desired changes (if any) then click "Update Code".
    3.4 Building the project
        Select the configuration to be built: RAM (Debug_RAM) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, Pmic_Configuration_Non_Autosar_Example_S32G399A_M7.elf binary file
        should be created.
    3.5 Running the project
        Go to \b Run and select \b Debug Configurations. See in left side, left click to "Pmic_Configuration_Non_Autosar_Example_S32G399A_M7_Debug_RAM_S32Debug"
        Go to tab Debugger, select "Interface" to S32 Debug Probe - USB
        Select USB device connect to S32 Probe Debugger
        Click "Apply" to save the configuration.
        Click "Debug" to start debug the application.
        Use the controls to control the program flow.
