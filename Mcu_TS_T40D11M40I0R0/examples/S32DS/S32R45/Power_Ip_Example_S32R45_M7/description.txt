1. Example Description 
    This application demonstrates the usage of the Power_Ip Driver.
    The application include a S32DS project that configure Power_Ip driver.
    1.1 The application software functionality:
        - Power_Ip_SetMode
            This example application demonstrates how to set up a power mode (enabling all peripherals) configuration for the board.
2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - Daughter card: X-S32R45-PROC-S PCB RevB RevX5 SCH RevB1
            - Motherboard: S32GRV-PLATEVB PCB RevA SCH RevB
            - Silicon: PS32R458AAMUD 0P57D SBAU2141A
        2.1.2 Connections
            - Powered board through power Adapter 12V
        2.1.3 Debugger
            The Lauterbach debugger must be connected to J190 JTAG Cortex Debug connector.
    2.2 Software installation
        Make sure that all RTD plugins are already installed in the S32DS plugins directory
3. How to run
    3.1 Importing the project into the workspace
        After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select "Power_Ip_Example_S32R45_M7". Then click on "Finish".
        The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
        Wait for the S32 Configuration was initialized and ready.
    3.2 Generating the S32 configuration
        The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
        The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
        Right click on the current project, then click "S32 Configuration Tool" choose "Open Peripherals".
        Pay attention to any error and warning message. If any configured value is invalid, they will be shown for user.
        Make the desired changes (if any) then click "Update Code".
    3.3 Building the project
        Select the configuration to be built: RAM (Debug_RAM) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, Power_Ip_Example_S32R45_M7.elf binary file
        should be created.
    3.4 Running the project
        Go to \b Run and select \b Debug Configurations. See in left side, left click to "Power_Ip_Example_S32R45_M7_Debug_RAM_S32Debug"
        Go to tab Debugger, select "Interface" to S32 Debug Probe - USB
        Select USB device connect to S32 Probe Debugger
        Click "Apply" to save the configuration.
        Click "Debug" to start debug the application.
        Use the controls to control the program flow.
